# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository

I'm an architect, currently not practicing, so I have pretty much spare time to learn new stuff like learning to code,
learning to make videogames, I've always been interested in CAD software, so I also want to learn the skills needed to create
useful plugins for the CAD software I use.
